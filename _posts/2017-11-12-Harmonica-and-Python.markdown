## Adventures with python:
-----------------------

So I was looking for something fun to make as my first 'real program' in python and I decided to make a tic-tac-toe game(command line based).
(I'm still quite the beginner in you can see exactly how I got started in this post)

Now I'm trying out GUI's in pyhton([TkInter library](https://youtu.be/-tbWoZSi3LU?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt))
and I plan on games(pygame) after this, you must absolutely check out derek banas on youtube as his [python in one video](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjvhfvb2rjXAhXJuo8KHcsZBUgQyCkIKTAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN4mEzFDjqtA&usg=AOvVaw0ASKQY00kfUyV-ld3zCla2) was 
what got me going, before that i had attempted [codecademy's python](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwikgOTE27jXAhWGs48KHdYSDT8QFggnMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2Flearn%2Flearn-python&usg=AOvVaw3KAY0Xab9Gxpo-wQSZKA1h) 
I'm actually a huge fan of sites like codecademy and freecodecamp because of their style in which we learn by doing whereas in 
videos i feel lazy to keep testing what the teacher is demonstrating yet it's easier to 'understand' from videos.

## Other Adventures:
-----------------

### Harmonica:
----------
I'm really excited to begin my musical journey on a harmonica and, after getting really interested in the instrument I've picked 
up _"Harmonica for Dummies"_ on the kindle and I'm enjoying the book(I have always enjoyed the for dummies books whenever I need to learn something)
I ordered a harmonica from amazon and it should come tomorrow. I guess I'll be learning from the book and [these resources.](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/8-sites-learn-play-harmonica-mouth-organ/)

### Entertainment:
--------------
This week it was also fun to watch _young sheldon_, and I also started _two broke girls_ as well,I like to watch an hour of TV before sleeping 
everyday(I guess i made this habit because cartoon network would broadcast Dragon Ball Z every night),
Other than TV, I also enjoyed playing "Gunman Clive" and continued reading the book "Killing Floor".

See you next week!
